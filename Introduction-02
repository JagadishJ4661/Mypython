find out car's mileage using starting and ending value of car's odometer

startingvalue = input("What is your starting value?")
startingvalue = int(startingvalue)
endingvalue = input("What is your ending value?")
endingvalue = int(endingvalue)
fuelconsumption = input("what is the fuel consumed?")
fuelconsumption = int(fuelconsumption)
Mileage = (endingvalue - startingvalue) / fuelconsumption
print(Mileage)

********************************************************************


Using the starting and ending values of the car's odometer and measure of fuel consumed
calculate the no of stops one could make for refueling, whiletraveling form Banglore to GOA
a distance of 560 km?


mileage = input("what is the mileage of the car?")
mileage = int(mileage)
tankcapacity = input("what is the tankcapacity?")
tankcapacity = int(tankcapacity)
distance = 560
distance_full = mileage*tankcapacity
Nooftime = distance / distance_full
value  = distance % distance_full
actualno = (distance // distance_full) + 1
if value == 0:
    print(Nooftime)
else:
    print(actualno)
